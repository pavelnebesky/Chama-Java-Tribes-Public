# Contributing to the project

## Restricted branches
- `development` - all the implemented features which are done and deployed
- `master` - stable version deployed

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch when you start to work on a story and commit your changes to this 
2. Push this frequently to the remote repository from your local
2. When the feature is done, create a Pull Request from the `feature_branch` to `development`, follow the guidelines
3. When the PR is approved, merge it, and delete your feature branch
