**DB MIGRATIONS WITH FLYWAY INSTRUCTIONS**

If you make **ANY** change to any model, you need to make new migration file, with SQL query with those changes.

**ADDING NEW THINGS TO MODELS**

Quite comfortable, you need:

1. Make those additions to models
2. Run the application
3. Wait until it successfully loads and then stop it
4. Make new migration file in correct conventional style with **sql** extension in db/migration
**V** for version then **underscores** and then description of changes : eg. **V004__Kingdom_model_added**
**Version must be higher than previous one!!!***
5. In **Update.sql** file in the project copy SQL query generated by Hibernate and copy it to your new migration file
6. **Delete contents of Update.sql**
7. Save everything, run application and pray.
8. If everything goes well, you successfully made new migration and you may check it in database

**REMOVING OR RENAMING THINGS IN MODELS**

Do not do that. When you rename model / it's property etc. it will create new column (instead of renaming column) and
old one will stay there as a unused garbage.
If you delete model / its property, it will stay there anyway.. **These things Hibernate will not make.**

**Only way to rename or remove a column from database is to make your own SQL query and put it in new migration file.**

If you don't want to do any of these things, just ask me and if you ask nicely and bring me coffee, I'll do that for you.
